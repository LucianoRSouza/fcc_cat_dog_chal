# fcc_cat_dog_chal
Challenge of the ML cats_dogs from FreeCodeCamp! 

This is my result for this challenge which I've achieved by trying all by myself, then some searching on the internet and by playing around with the hyperparameters.

Result:
Your model correctly identified 84.0% of the images of cats and dogs.
You passed the challenge!

I'm really happy with it! :)
